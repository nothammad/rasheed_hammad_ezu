Customizing the Django Admin clearly has benefits that we have previously explored and learned how to improve our development processes from. In this scenario, we are able to imrpove our process with the Django Admin in a variety of different ways. Two customizations that can assist greatly would be inline editing and bulk actions. These two customizations have the ability to make data entry and testing much faster and much more efficient. This would allow you to test your application with a variety of different test cases with ease. Inline editing allows for records to be edited directly within a parent model's admin page and it would be able to help to save time and make managing data more efficient. To implement, this, in admin.py you can create an inline model for the related objects and attach the inline model to the parent model's admin class. For the second customization, which is bulk updates, it would allow for action actions that would deploy batch updates. For example, changing a large amount of student's registrations simultaneously. This can be a lot more efficient because you wouldn't have to manually change al of the data and it can trivialize repetitive tasks. To implement this, you would have to define a custom action in admin.py and register the action with the admin class. Doing so would allow for the bulk actions to be operational via the Django Admin.
