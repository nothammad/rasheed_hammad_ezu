Pagination and static files are a very important concept and can make Django applications much more powerful and immersive. Using the Django Admin adn these concepts, you may be able to make much more progress with easy customizations to improve the development process. A specific customization that could be implemented could be enabling pagination in the Django Admin interface. This would allow large datasets to be used and accessed easier in the Instructor and Student lists. Pagination is implemented in the front-end, but to make it easier for development, you can implement it in the Django Admin to make the process easier. To do this, you could modify the list_per_page attribute in the ModelAdmin class to change the amount of records displayed per page. Another customization that could be added is a method to manage and organize static files within the Django Admin. An interface to access the static files in the admin would allow for better organization and more accessibility. To do this, you would have to create a StaticFile model that maintains a record of all of the static files and add a specific Admin class so that the file types could be filtered and identified. Overall, static files and pagination are very strong resources and specific customizations related them can be implemented to the Django Admin to improve development processes.
